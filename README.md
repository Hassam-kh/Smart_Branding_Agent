# Smart_Branding_Agent
**Creating an env is recommended**<br>
I've successfully developed a Django Project featuring a cutting-edge social media marketing agent powered by Llama2-7B, LangChain, and Bing image creator.<br> 
The primary challenge revolved around **efficiently implementing these substantial and resource-intensive models to run seamlessly on a local _environment/PC_**.
